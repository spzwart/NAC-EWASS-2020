Dear EAS Annual Meeting 2020 Board,

We are writing to you with regards to our proposal to host the
Nederlandse Astronomen Conferentie (NAC) as a symposium during EAS AM
2020. The meeting is intended for astronomy students and professional
astronomers to come together to share their recent research results
and meet science journalists, industry partners and science policy
makers. An important part of the NAC is the development of the Dutch
astronomical family feeling. The NAC is typically attended by a few
hundred people. From the perspective of the EAS AM, the opportunities
offered by hosting the conferences simultaneously are plenty. The NAC
2020 LOC asserts that having so many Dutch astronomers present at the
EAS AM venue enriches the couleur locale for astronomers from abroad,
who can more easily get in touch with Dutch culture and traditions, as
well as with Dutch flagship projects, such as the LOFAR radio
telescope and SRONâ€™s ATHENA mission.

Our request is for 1 large auditorium (75-100 people) and 1 small room
(15 people) for Tuesday to Fridays (4 days) from 14:30 to 18:00. A
range of topics will need to be covered by both talks and hands-on
sessions (in parallel). Each day will start with a 'focus talk', given
by an invited speaker. This presentation is followed by 2 hours of
contributed talks (20 min each), divided by the coffee break. The day
is closed by another invited talk. This second invitee should present
a topic's overview. During the talks, there will be more hands-on
'hack' sessions in parallel in a smaller room. Here people can come
together to, for example, go to a tutorial, a lecture or in another
way more interactive session to learn about particular topics, such as
outreach or data reduction. Some of these session could be more
hands-on, with participants actually doing work (e.g. AMUSE,
outreach), while others that are more or too involved to do on the
spot (e.g. LOFAR, GAIA), could perhaps be more like a talk/discussion
session to give more insight in e.g. how to obtain and reduce the
data.

Although the NAC is typically attended by a few hundred people, the
fact that it will be held concurrent and colocated with EAS AM will
mean that NAC will not be hosting all of them at the same time. For
that reason, we expect an auditorium for ~100 people and a small room
for ~15 people to be enough room.

We would use two rooms:
1 large auditorium (75-100 people)
1 small meeting room (15 people)
Each for two 1.5-hour blocks for four days (Tuesday to Friday).

The list of topics should include Outreach, Instrumentation,
Simulations and modeling, Multi-messenger astronomy, Imaging,
Spectroscopy, Theory, and Interferometry, but of course with a focus
on Dutch astronomy. We strive for a balance in senior and junior
researchers, in gender balance, on topical coverage and geographical
coverage. We expect to invite people from the following institutions:
University of Groningen (RuG), Leiden University (LU), Radboud
University (RU), VU Amsterdam (VU), ASTRON, SRON, NIKHEF, with
contribution from Belgian astronomy.

So far we have identified the following potential invited speakers (no
speakers have been contacted yet or have confirmed):

1a (Outreach): Pedro Russo (LU), Peter Barthel (RuG), Joeri van Leeuwen (UvA, Vici), Bas Haring (UL), Ionica Smeets (UL)
1b (Instrumentation): Paul Groot (RU), Peter Jonker (RU), Jelle Kaastra (SRON), Hiroki Akamatsu (SRON), Aurora Simionescu (SRON)
2a (Simulations and modeling): Amina Helmi (RuG, Vici + Spinoza), Adrian Hamers (IAS)
2b (Multi-messenger astronomy): Gijs Nelemans (RU, Vici), Michiel van der Klis (UvA, Spinoza), Yamilia Miguel (UL)
3a (Imaging): Marc Verheijen (RuG, Vici), Ewine van Dishoeck (LU, Spinoza)
3b (Spectroscopy): Ignas Snellen (LU, Vici), Xander Tielens (LU, Spinoza), Elisa Constantini (UvA)
4a (Theory): Sera Markoff (UvA, Vici), Erik Verlinde (UvA), Chris van den Broek (NIKHEF, Vici), Elena Sellentin (UL)
4b (Inteferometry): Heino Falkce (RU, Spinoza)

We give special emphasis to newly hired staff astronomers, gender
balance, institutional balance and on a wide diversity of topics.


Whereas EAS will be equipped with electronic posters, during the NAC,
we would prefer the use of paper posters, which can be displayed in
the long corridor connecting the hotel with the main venue. In this
way, the NAC posters remain distinct from the EAS posters, and we can
have our NAC poster prize as usual.

We will have a posterprize committee consisting of:
Peter Barthel (RUG)         
Stephanie Cazeau (TU Delft)         
Paul Groot (RU)
Lex Kaper (UvA)
Frans Snik (LU)

Our preliminary Science Organising Committee consists of Simon
Portegies Zwart (chair), Jab Lub and Huub Rottgering.

In addition to the auditorium and the small meeting room we would also
like to use the vide above the main auditorium for the entire week as
a 'Dutch Garden' for the Dutch astronomy community to informally
meet. At the Dutch Garden we will have 4 lego building projects, each
of one of the universities in the Netherlands, and each of them will
build a VLT.  After the conference, they can bring their own built VLT
to their home institution to display. The cost for this activity is
about 700euro/VLT. Alternatively, we could contract a company to make
a very large photo puzzle depicting something related to Dutch
astronomy and let the attendees put it together. This is more cost
effective, but probably les fun.

We intend to include the following outreach activities. 

To involve Dutch primary school children, we will organize a
kids-press-conference. Local primary schools (8th grade) will be
invited to ask questions during the kids-press-conference. During this
event the children can ask questions to a real professor. We will
arrange for a panel of highly esteemed (and not scary) professors to
address the kids' questions.

We also intend to organize a PhD write session on popularizing their
PhD. Under supervision of a number of journalists, graduate students
can write a small newspaper article about the most exciting result
from their PhD thesis (or a general astrophyiscs topic). Three
(depending how many can be published) of these will be published in a
paper venue for children such as the Kids Week. This activity can be
held in one of the small meeting rooms.

We could accomodate 1, 2 or even 3 mobile planetaria in the great hall
of the Holiday Inn. This room is not extremely suitable for much else
anyway.

With kind regards,
Simon Portegies Zwart, Lydia Stofanova, Dirk van Dam, Rafael Mostert, Frits Sweijen, Martijn Wilhelm and Martijn Oei (members of the EAS AM 2020 SOC and LOC, and the NAC 2020 SOC and LOC; Leiden Observatory)
